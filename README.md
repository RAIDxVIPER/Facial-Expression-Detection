# 😊 Facial Expression Detection

## Overview
This project detects facial expressions using OpenCV and a deep learning model. It classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more. 🎭

## Features
- 🎥 Real-time facial expression detection
- 🧠 Pre-trained deep learning model for emotion recognition
- 📷 Integration with OpenCV for face detection
- 😀 Supports multiple expressions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/facial-expression-detection.git
cd facial-expression-detection

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python detect_expression.py
```

## Dependencies
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖼️ OpenCV
- 🔬 TensorFlow/Keras
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📊 Matplotlib

## Model
The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model, such as MobileNetV2 or a custom CNN trained on a facial expression dataset (e.g., FER-2013). 🤖

## Dataset
The dataset used for training includes labeled facial images with different expressions. A common dataset for this task is FER-2013, which contains:
- 📷 35,000+ grayscale images
- 😃 7 emotion classes: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Fear, Surprise, Disgust

## Future Improvements
- 🚀 Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
- 🌍 Deploy the model as a web or mobile application
- ⚡ Optimize performance for real-time detection
